# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Site crawlability:** `apps/site` writes `/robots.txt` and `/sitemap.xml` from the shared prerender route list (`/` and `/about`) with absolute `https://desktop-tooling.github.io/nikon-camera-bridge/` URLs.

### Changed

- **Diagram checks and runtime:** Kept Windows-rendered Mermaid geometry canonical while Linux CI verifies platform-neutral source hashes, source renderability, and the committed output families; explicitly installed the pinned Puppeteer browser with a GitHub Actions-only sandbox configuration; and moved sanitized SVG enhancement to the client entry so it survives client navigation and reconnects.
- **Architecture diagrams:** Replaced all eight inline Mermaid blocks in the root and package READMEs with accessible standalone-adaptive SVGs backed by editable Mermaid sources, version 1 theme manifests, host-runtime siblings, fixed light variants, and reproducible freshness checks using `@dev-centr/themed-svg` 0.1.1 and `@dev-centr/mermaid-svg-css-vars` 0.1.2. Added adaptive Antora delivery and sanitized progressive enhancement for the SolidStart architecture diagram.
- **Documentation:** Added a continuously published `nikon-camera-bridge` Antora component for the Desktop Tooling docs hub, linked it from the public README, and documented the scaffolded control surfaces and planned virtual-camera pipeline.
- **License:** Relicensed from **MIT** to **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 or later** (`AGPL-3.0-or-later`): full text in [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE), SPDX in workspace `package.json` files, WinGet / Homebrew / AUR templates, marketing site footer, and desktop about copy. Strong copyleft applies to distributed derivatives; AGPL **network** rules apply when modified code is run as a **remote** service for users (relevant for the control API direction in `packages/api`).
- **Desktop release artifacts**: Windows **`.msi`**, **`.msix`**, and portable **`.zip`** (x64 + arm64); macOS **`.dmg`**; Linux **`.deb`**, **`.AppImage`**, and electron-builder **`.flatpak`** single-file bundles. CI installs **Flatpak** tooling on Ubuntu runners. WinGet generated manifests list **MSI**, **MSIX**, and portable **zip**; Homebrew cask **`webcam-bridge-for-nikon`** uses **DMG** URLs; AUR template **`webcam-bridge-for-nikon-bin`** unpacks the **`.deb`**.
- **Product name** for the shipped desktop app and marketing site: **Webcam Bridge for Nikon**. Release file prefix **`Webcam.Bridge.for.Nikon-*`**. **Microsoft Store** listing [9N90Q0C8F6ZW](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9n90q0c8f6zw); MSIX **`identityName`** `AMDphreak.WebcamBridgeforNikon`, **`publisher`** `CN=6AC37873-9F91-4911-9411-D11B8BA63A5C`. WinGet package id **`AMDphreak.WebcamBridgeforNikon`**.
- **Dependencies:** Refreshed deprecated `@xmldom/xmldom` 0.9.10 to 0.9.12 (pulled by `electron-builder` via `plist`) within its existing range.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- **`apps/site`**: SolidStart (**1.x** + Vinxi) marketing site with prerendered **`/`** and **`/about`**, GitHub Pages base path via `VITE_BASE_PATH`, and [`.github/workflows/pages.yml`](./.github/workflows/pages.yml) for deployment from `main` (enable **Pages → GitHub Actions** in repo settings).
- Root scripts **`pnpm run build:site`** and **`pnpm run dev:site`**.
- Desktop builds for **Linux** (`.deb`, `.AppImage`, `.flatpak`, x64 + arm64) and **macOS** (`.dmg`, x64 + arm64) alongside **Windows** (`.msi` + portable `.zip`, x64 + arm64); `artifactName` includes OS and arch.
- `docs/distribution.md` with WinGet, Homebrew, Debian/Flatpak, and AUR maintainer flows.
- `scripts/render-winget.mjs` and `scripts/render-homebrew-cask.mjs`; release workflow attaches generated manifests next to binaries.
- `distrib/flatpak/README.md` and `distrib/aur/PKGBUILD.in` templates for Linux packaging ecosystems.

### Changed

- Repository and product naming: GitHub **`AMDphreak/nikon-camera-bridge`**, pnpm scope **`@nikon-camera-bridge/*`**, desktop app **Nikon Camera Bridge**, release archives **`Nikon.Camera.Bridge-*`**, WinGet **`AMDphreak.NikonCameraBridge`**, Homebrew cask **`nikon-camera-bridge`**. The CI site job sets **`VITE_BASE_PATH`** from **`github.event.repository.name`** so the GitHub Pages base stays aligned with the repo slug.
- Desktop Windows/Linux/macOS packaging uses **separate `directories.output` staging folders** per architecture so parallel **x64** and **arm64** artifacts do not fight over the same unpacked directory (important on Windows).

### Fixed

- Linux **`.deb`** builds: electron-builder’s FPM path requires **`homepage`** (and benefits from **`repository`**) in `apps/desktop/package.json`; without it, `deb` failed after `tar.gz` succeeded.

[0.3.0]: https://github.com/AMDphreak/nikon-camera-bridge/releases/tag/v0.3.0

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- pnpm workspace: **core**, **api**, **video**, and **desktop** packages with a shared pnpm scope (renamed to **`@nikon-camera-bridge/*`** when the GitHub repository was renamed).
- HTTP stub server in `packages/api` (`GET /health`, `GET /v1/state`, `POST /v1/command`, `POST /v1/state/mirror`).
- Component README files with focused Mermaid diagrams; root README documents the full system and layout tables.
- CI: Ubuntu builds `packages/*`; Windows builds the desktop zip and packs all library `.tgz` files in one job (packing on Linux runners was unreliable with pnpm `pack`).
- Release workflow on `v*` tags attaches all `.tgz` files plus the Windows zip.
- `scripts/pack-workspace.mjs` runs `pnpm pack` from each `packages/*` directory so CI env vars like `npm_config_recursive` do not break `pnpm pack`.
- pnpm `confirmModulesPurge: false` and `public-hoist-pattern` for Electron so local installs and **electron-builder** behave under the workspace layout.
- Desktop `build.electronVersion` pinned for electron-builder when Electron is hoisted by pnpm.

### Changed

- Electron app moved to `apps/desktop`; root `package.json` is now a private workspace orchestrator.
- `prepare` runs `pnpm run build:packages` after install so workspace `dist/` exists for the desktop build.

[0.2.0]: https://github.com/AMDphreak/nikon-camera-bridge/releases/tag/v0.2.0

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-11

### Added

- Electron + electron-vite + TypeScript desktop shell with bridge status UI.
- IPC surface for future exclusive acquisition and virtual camera toggles (stubbed).
- GitHub Actions workflow for install, typecheck, and Windows build artifacts.
- Release workflow that attaches the Windows zip when a version tag is pushed.
- Documentation describing the intended layering (physical USB, demux, virtual sink, control API).

[0.1.0]: https://github.com/AMDphreak/nikon-camera-bridge/releases/tag/v0.1.0
